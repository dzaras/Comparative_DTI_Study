# Comparative Analysis of Shannon Entropy as a measurement to examine similarities in white matter integrity using DTI scans of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Mild Cognitive Impairment. 

A group of R scripts that explores and analyzes selected cases from the ABIDE II and ADNI datasets of patients with Alzheimer's Disease, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Mild Cognitive Impairment. The study is a comparative analysis of Shannon Entropy as a measurement to examine similarities in white matter integrity between neurodegenerative and developmental disorders using DTI scans of patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Mild Cognitive Impairment. The goal is to identify potential similarities between the cases with different conditions in terms of the Shannon Entropy measurement.
The R scripts in this repo are focused on data management/wrangling, exploratory analysis using visualization and descriptive statistics, and hypothesis testing.
